![waybackmachine]({{ "/assets/waybackmachine.png" | absolute_url }})

Have you ever wondered what some of these major websites looked like when they first launched? Widely recognized companies
like Facebook, Google, and Amazon all went through awkward phases in terms of web design throughout the years. Today we
have access to these incredible tools that significantly aid in the aesthetics and overall functionality of creating a
webpage. To make sure you don't take these things for granted, take a walk down memory lane with WaybackMachine.

![thefacebook]({{ "/assets/thefacebook.png" | absolute_url }})

Before Facebook became the household name that we all recognize today, it started off as 'thefacebook.com'. The website
was exclusive to Harvard University and was incredibly different to what we see today.

![google]({{ "/assets/google.png" | absolute_url }})

This is a snapshot of what google.com looked like in March, 2000. Using WaybackMachine actually lets you browse the website as you would have 18 years ago. Navigating to the jobs section offers some insight into what kinds of skills would have gotten you the first developer positions at Google.

The incredibly useful tool can be found at https://web.archive.org/
