Javascript animations are a great way to spice up your projects.  From animations that will accomplish tasks such as rotating an object, to creating a piece of art that becomes the center of your site.  The libraries listed below have you covered. -----Definitely need to go back and reformat-----

For creating simple animations, WickedCSS is a great place to start.

![Wicked Instructions]({{ "/assets/WickedInstructions.png" | absolute_url }})
After the stylesheet is added, all you have to do is add the appropriate class tag

Mojs.io is another library for Javascript animations that offers step-by-step tutorials.  Click on 'tutorials'
and from there you should see a large variety of really impressive shapes and animations created with this tool and implemented with Javascript
