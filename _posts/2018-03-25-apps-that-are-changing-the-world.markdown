Whenever we think of applications that are 'Changing the World', we will probably think of all the big names.  Like Facebook, who has amassed over 2 billions users and is integrated into countless other applications.  Or maybe Netflix, who streams over 10 billion hours of content every month.

I'd like to make this a shout out post to all of lesser-known apps that truly change the lives of their users.

![Be My Eyes]({{ "/assets/BeMyEyes.png" | absolute_url }})

This app is truly inspiring. BeMyEyes is an application that allows a person without sight to 'borrow a pair of eyes' from someone on the other end of the application via a video stream.  From checking expiration dates, to being lost in public, it has to be a relief to know that whatever happens, you have someone to lean on.

![AVAZ app]({{ "/assets/AVAZapp.png" | absolute_url }})

AVAZ is a picture and text based communication application that has been developed to help children who face difficulties communicating.  This app gives users with conditions such as autism or Down syndrome the ability to communicate via pictures on a smartphone or tablet.

![VoiceItt]({{ "/assets/VoiceItt.png" | absolute_url }})

VoiceItt goes above and beyond with not the idea behind the application but also the technology.  It allows users with otherwise unintelligible speech, and translates it into understandable vocals.  People who have had stroke, or have a condition such as ALS or Parkinson's disease now have the ability to communicate using their own voice.
