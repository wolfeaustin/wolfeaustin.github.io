Whenever we think of applications that are 'Changing the World', we will probably think of all the big names.  Like Facebook, who has amassed over 2 billions users and is integrated into countless other applications.  Or maybe Netflix, who streams over 10 billion hours of content every month.

I'd like to make this a shout out post to all of lesser-known apps that truly change the lives of their users who would otherwise be helpless.
